// Write a program that will output numbers from 10 to 20.
// Do it using `for`, `while` and `do while` loops.

// Modify your code, so that your program will output only even numbers.

// Modify your code again, so that it becomes a function with two arguments, determining range of numbers to output (from a to b).
function numbers(a, b) {}

//function call
numbers(100, 110);
